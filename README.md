# CS6460-Project
Python for Financial Analysts: An Introduction with Jupyter Notebooks

## Installation

First, to get the notebooks you can either clone or download this repository.

To clone, you will need git for your operating system: https://git-scm.com/downloads

Git is the leading version control system for developers and data scientists to store source code.

Second, we need to get Python installed. It's certainly possible to go to https://www.python.org/downloads/ and get the core Python distrbution. However, the Anaconda Distribution packages core Python with additional libraries and tools that are relevant to data analysis.

1. https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section
2. Select your operating system and download Python 3.7 version.
3. Step through the installation process
4. Open Anaconda Navigator
5. Launch Jupyter Lab

At this point you are ready to navigate to the notebooks folder and open `1 Introduction to Python 1 (basics).ipynb`.

Notebooks have 2 modes, command and edit mode. When you open a notebook, you start in command mode. You can quickly navigate cells with arrow keys in command mode, as well as several other keyboard shortcuts such as deleting a cell with `dd`.

In either mode, you can execute the cells that are code with either `shift + enter` (executes and moves cursor to next cell) or `ctrl + enter` (execute and stay on current cell).

Conversely you can click on a code cell and enter edit mode which allows you to update the code like a normal text editor.
